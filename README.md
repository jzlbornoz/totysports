# TOTY Sports - PWA Project

This is the readme file for the "TOTY Sports" progressive web application (PWA) project. The project is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It also utilizes other libraries such as Framer Motion. The application features order processing, a section for favorite articles, and a shopping cart. All of this functionality is implemented with data persistence using localStorage. Additionally, a custom hook called `useLocalStorage` and `useContext` are used for managing and accessing data.

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## Build

To build the production-ready application, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized production build of the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can explore the various features and functionalities of TOTY Sports. Here are some key features to get you started:

- **Order Processing**: Navigate to the order processing section to place orders for sports-related items.
- **Favorite Items**: Use the favorite articles section to save and view your preferred sports articles.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add items to your shopping cart and proceed to checkout when you're ready to purchase.
